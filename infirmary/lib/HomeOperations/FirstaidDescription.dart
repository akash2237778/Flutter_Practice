    headings[0] = 'First aid bandage';
    description[0] = '''In many cases, you can use an adhesive bandage to cover minor cuts, scrapes, or burns. To cover and protect larger wounds, you might need to apply a clean gauze pad or roller bandage.
To apply a roller bandage to a wound, follow these steps:
    1. Hold the injured area steady.
    2. Gently but firmly wrap the bandage around the injured limb or body part, covering the wound.
    3. Fasten the bandage with sticky tape or safety pins.
    4. The bandage should be wrapped firmly enough to stay put, but not so tightly that it cuts off blood flow.
To check the circulation in a bandaged limb, pinch one of the person’s fingernails or toenails until the color drains from the nail. If color doesn’t return within two seconds of letting go, the bandage is too tight and needs to be adjusted.''';

    headings[1] = 'First aid for burns';
    description[1] = '''If you suspect that someone has a third-degree burn, call 911. Seek professional medical care for any burns that:
    • cover a large area of skin
    • are located on the person’s face, groin, buttocks, hands, or feet
    • have been caused by contact with chemicals or electricity
To treat a minor burn, run cool water over the affected area for up to 15 minutes. If that’s not possible, apply a cool compress to the area instead. Avoid applying ice to burned tissue. It can cause more damage.
Over-the-counter pain relievers can help relieve pain. Applying lidocaine or an aloe vera gel or cream can also reduce discomfort from minor burns.
To help prevent infection, apply an antibiotic ointment and loosely cover the burn with clean gauze.''';

    headings[2] = 'First aid CPR';
    description[2] = '''If you see someone collapse or find someone unconscious, call 911. If the area around the unconscious person seems safe, approach them and begin CPR.
Even if you don’t have formal training, you can use hands-only CPR to help keep someone alive until professional help arrives.
Here’s how to treat an adult with hands-only CPR:
    1. Place both hands on the center of their chest, with one hand on top of the other.
    2. Press straight down to compress their chest repeatedly, at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute.
    3. Compressing the chest to the beat of “Staying Alive” by the Bee Gees or “Crazy in Love” by Beyoncé can help you count at the correct rate.
    4. Continue performing chest compressions until professional help arrives.''';

    headings[3] = 'First aid for bee sting';
    description[3] = '''For some people, a bee sting is a medical emergency. If a person is having an allergic reaction to a bee sting, call 911. If they have an epinephrine auto-injector (like an EpiPen), help them find and use it. Encourage them to remain calm until help arrives.
Someone who’s stung by a bee and showing no signs of an allergic reaction can usually be treated without professional help.
If the stinger is still stuck under the skin, gently scrape a credit card or other flat object across their skin to remove it. Then wash the area with soap and water and apply a cool compress for up to 10 minutes at a time to reduce pain and swelling.
To treat itching or pain from the sting, consider applying calamine lotion or a paste of baking soda and water to the area several times a day.''';

    headings[4] = 'First aid for nosebleed';
    description[4] = '''To treat someone with a nosebleed, ask them to:
    1. Sit down and lean their head forward.
    2. Using the thumb and index finger, firmly press or pinch the nostrils closed.
    3. Continue to apply this pressure continuously for five minutes.
    4. Check and repeat until the bleeding stops.
If you have nitrile of vinyl gloves, you can press or pinch their nostril closed for them.
If the nosebleed continues for 20 minutes or longer, seek emergency medical care. The person should also receive follow-up care if an injury caused the nosebleed.''';

    headings[5] = 'First aid for heatstroke';
    description[5] = '''When your body overheats, it can cause heat exhaustion. If left untreated, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke. This is a potentially life-threatening condition and medical emergency.
If someone is overheated, encourage them to rest in a cool location. Remove excess layers of clothing and try to cool their body down by doing the following:
    • Cover them with a cool, damp sheet.
    • Apply a cool, wet towel to the back of their neck.
    • Sponge them with cool water.
Call 911 if they develop signs or symptoms of heatstroke, including any of the following:
    • nausea or vomiting
    • mental confusion
    • fainting
    • seizures
    • a fever of 104°F (40°C) or greater
If they’re not vomiting or unconscious, encourage them to sip cool water or a sports drink.''';

    headings[6] = 'First aid for heart attack';
    description[6] = '''If you think someone might be experiencing a heart attack, call 911. If they’ve been prescribed nitroglycerin, help them locate and take this medication. Cover them with a blanket and comfort them until professional help arrives.
If they have difficulty breathing, loosen any clothing around their chest and neck. Start CPR if they lose consciousness.''';
